## Reporting a Vulnerability

The security of the SDG Analysis Dashboard is important to us. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings.

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it to us by emailing Fiacre Rougieux at fiacre.rougieux@unsw.edu.au.

Please include the following details with your report:
*   A description of the vulnerability.
*   Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
*   The potential impact of the vulnerability.
*   Any mitigations or suggestions you might have.

We will make every effort to respond to your report promptly, acknowledge receipt, and outline the next steps. We kindly ask that you do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until we have had a chance to address it.

Thank you for helping keep the SDG Analysis Dashboard secure.
